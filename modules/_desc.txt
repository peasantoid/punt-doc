These are the modules that ship with the core punt source distribution. They
are the ones we believe to be necessary for any half-decent programming
environment.

Note: because of how punt modules are built, you may notice some in the source
tree that are not, strictly speaking, 'necessary'. This is because the
developers were too lazy to remove them prior to committing.
